These addons were checked for any sensitive or revealing information that could be potentially harmful towards our users. If you, the reader, see ANY potentially sensitive, revealing, or harmful information or data anywhere in this repository, please immediately reach out through a pull request or to one of our staff members.

In addition, please remember that these addons were made over the course of several years, and have altered significantly compared to their original state. They very well may not work in the presence of other community addons, and likely will not function properly unless loaded alongside other addons in this collection. We will provide zero official support, guidance, or troubleshooting to anyone that would like to use these addons, so please do so at your own risk.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you all are able to enjoy these addons now that Hazard cannot.
